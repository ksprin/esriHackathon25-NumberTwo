# ESRI Hackathon25 NumberTwo - Gotta Go

## What this Repository is

This repository is a fork of my team's project from the 2025 Esri Intern Hackathon, which I participated in during my internship there in the Summer of 2025. The goal of the hackathon was for teams to construct an application that uses Esri technology within one weekend. My team created the "GottaGo" app that directs users to their nearest public restroom. It was made with JavaScript and React. I have included a video demo on this repository. Our team was a finalist in the competition. 

Team Members: Kayla Sprincis, Alex Van De Water, Patricia Zwolinski, Simran Gawri, Wynnie Gross, and Chris Sanrow

## About

Gotta Go is a standalone React web application that utilizes ArcGIS SDK technology to provide users with a seamless way to find convenient bathrooms on the go.

## For Developers

### Project Setup

In order to contribute to this project, you should start by cloning the repo onto your local machine.

Then, you must install node.js in order to obtain all the necessary dependencies.

Open the project in your IDE of choice, then in a terminal cd into the project's directory.

Then run `cd number-two` and `npm i`, which will install the necessary dependencies. (NOTE: if you receive a permission error, you should run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
` in a separate Powershell terminal

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, run `npm run dev`. This will start an instance of the web app in on localhost, which you can now prototype on!

### React Dev Tips

- You can install the React Developers Tools extension for convenient in-browser debugging options.

- If you hit Ctrl+Shift+I to open the inspect element menu, you can click the symbol shown below to simulate the dimensions of a phone.
